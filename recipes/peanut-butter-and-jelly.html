    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>From wartime to playtime, who can resist this scrumptious sandwich. This remains the go-to on-the-go lunch in our house.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices - Sandwich bread</li>
        <li>Peanut butter (Crunchy or smooth)</li>
        <li>Jelly (Choose your favorite. My household prefers strawberry.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a knife or spoon, scoop out a hefty helping of peanut butter and spread it over the first slice of bread.</li>
        <li>If you have the squeezable jelly, you can squeeze a decent dollop onto the second slice of bread and use the same utensil from step 1 to spread the jelly. Otherwise, use a clean spoon to scoop out jelly onto the second slice of bread and spread.</li>
        <li>Now, merry the two slices of bread with the peanut butter- and jelly-sides facing one another, and serve with your favorite chips.</li>
    </ol>
